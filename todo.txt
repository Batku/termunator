
TODO LIST (AI generated formating)

CRITICAL
--------
[!!!] SFTP: transfer queue
[!!] Notifications

IMPORTANT UX & CORE
-------------------
[!!] Make macros work
[!!] History save
    - Macros from frequent commands
[!!] Changing layout of SFTP should not reload (only reloads visibly on frontend so ig its fine for now doesnt cuase extra server load)
    - Also save client and host home directory inside it, doesnt take much performance to fetch but its fine
[!!] sudo perms in sftp
[!!] Account
[!!] actually save settings (2 options locally or account)  -- last

GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS
--------------------
- sftp more 
    -select all 
    -new folder 
    -functionality to delete
[!]- switch between tabs with ctrl tab or chosen keybind ctrl shift tab maybe to not colldie with anything
- Close on exit (when input is 'exit', run healthcheck?) Ubuntu returns 'logout', many OSes
- Fix scrollbar later (and resizing) — low priority
- get os on first connection and get image from there
